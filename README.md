    > git clone https://github.com/Detroit2077/ETH-AVAX-Module-2.git
```

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your local device.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: `npm i`
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: `npx hardhat node`
4. In the third terminal, type: `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`
5. Back in the first terminal, type `npm run dev` to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost.
Typically at `http://localhost:3000/`

Now you can perform different operations and analyze the functions used in the Project.
